# Accenture - SocialBuzz: Social media content analysis
This project is a job simulation prepared by Accenture available on Forage website.

## Executive Summary
Using Excel, PowerPoint and Looker, I cleaned, transformed and visualised dataset provided by Accenture's client, Social Buzz, to answer their business demands. After analysing the sample dataset, I offer the following insights to the big data audit team for further action:
1. The most popular categories are asssociated to positive sentiments, with some to negative. To safeguard users, consider introducing features that allow users to mute trigger words and/or topics, and create visual prompts of trigger warnings. 
2. The heaviest traffic flow tend to be in the morning and early morning. Ensure relevant teams oversee that the server is up and running for these period.

## Business Questions
As per the client brief, Social Buzz made three demands in their partnership with Accenture. One of them being wanting to understand how the world's biggest companies manage the challenges of big data. The analytics team is responsible for conducting an analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity

## Methodology

2. Clean and transform data using Excel.
3. Visualise findings using Excel.
4. Prepare slide deck using PowerPoint.
5. Create interactive dashboard using Looker.

Using the Looker dashboard, I discovered the following insights:
1. Top 5 categories: animals, healthy eating, technology, science, cooking
2. Content type: majority of contents were in the form of photo, followed by video, GIF and audio. Whilst most other categories came in almost similar proportions for every content type, animal contents were mostly photo and audio, and technology mostly in audio.
3. Time of posts: highest user traffic is reported in the morning, followed by early morning, afternoon, then evening. Usage volume is consistent throughout the week.
4. Sentiment: The majority of posts are associated to positive sentiments, followed by negative, and a fraction of neutral sentiments. All top 5 categories are associated to positive and neutral sentiments to varying degrees, only animal, cooking and healthy eating are negatively associated. 
5. However, the top reaction types showed a mix of positive (heart, interested, adore), negative (scare, hate, dislike) and neutral (peeking)
